$cmd [options...] command args [...]
$cmd [options...] {--file | -f} file... {--command | -c} command [args...]

Repeatedly run a command whenever the file(s) it acts on change, or
when any given file changes.

In the first case, the command's arguments are examined and valid
files are watched.

In the second case, all files must be immediately after the "-f"
argument and the command (with its args) after the "-c" argument, and
only explicitly given files are watched.

Options:

--force    Don't exit on nonzero command return value (i.e., only
           exit when interrupted with, e.g., ^C).
--debug    Show diagnostic information.
