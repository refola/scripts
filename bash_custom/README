# This folder contains files ready for symlinking if you want to
# mirror my custom Bash shell configuration on your own system.

# To use this:
# 1. Set your ~/.bash_logout, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.logout,
#    and ~/.profile to link to the corresponding files here.
# 2. Make the folders ~/.bash.d and ~/.bash.d/history
# 3. Cross your fingers and start a new Bash session.
