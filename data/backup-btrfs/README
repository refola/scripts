Here's how to set ssd2hdds.sh to run regularly via systemd.

# after cd'ing to here
sudo cp "$(readlink -f "$(which ssd2hdds)")" /sbin # copy script
sudo cp ./ssd2hdds.{timer,service} /etc/systemd/system # copy units
sudo systemctl enable ssd2hdds.service # needed for timer
sudo systemctl enable ssd2hdds.timer # run it "often enough"
sudo systemctl start ssd2hdds.timer # start it without rebooting
systemctl list-timers # check that it's working
