msg "Warning: chaser is currently poorly supported due to lack of a
clean mechanism to install packages via the correct program (i.e.,
choosing between pacman and chaser). It is also currently slower than
ccr. It is recommended to reinstall ccr and add ccr to pacman.conf's
IgnorePkg line to keep ccr from being replaced by chaser.

That is, please run this command

   pm in ccr

and then look for an 'IgnorePkg' line in '/etc/pacman.conf' and change
add 'ccr' to the right side of the ' = '. Make sure to uncomment the
line if it starts with a '#'."

scmd pacman -Syuw --noconfirm
scmd pacman -Su
cmd chaser update
