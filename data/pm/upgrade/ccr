msg "Note: ccr is officially deprecated, but pm will continue to
prefer it until chaser is improved. See [TODO: add bug urls] for
chaser's status.

In particular, 'chaser install' is CCR-only (and I haven't been able
to figure out reliable commands to determine if pacman can install a
package) and 'chaser update' is slower than 'ccr -Syu --ccronly'."

scmd pacman -Syuw --noconfirm
scmd pacman -Su
cmd ccr -Syu --ccronly
