## pms

# This is a list of package managers for the `pm` multi-distro package
# manager frontend script. Each comment line is identified by a
# leading `#`. Each word in a non-comment line is interpreted as a
# package manager command name to search for, with the first one
# winning. See `README.md` for how to make the helper scripts that
# `pm` uses for package management operations once it`s found a
# package manager in this list.


## Higher-level package managers

# These provide extra features like automatic sudo invocation and
# building packages from user / community repositories, and are thus
# preferred if available.

# Chakra package managers which supported the CCR when it was a thing
ccr chaser

# Arch package managers which support the AUR

## Lower-level package managers

# These are the basic package manager commands which should be present
# even if fancier options aren't available. These are listed last so
# they're used only if there's no higher-level option.
