the point where dealing with shell language quirks takes more time
than is saved by easier access to running programs and redirecting

### limitations ###

# This script assumes that you mostly just want the latest data. It
# does not backup older snapshots.

# This script uses 1-second time granularity, so new snapshots are
# "always" made (the exception being if this script on somehow
# finishes in under a second on your system).


### filesystem layout ###

# The original subvolumes can be anywhere under the respective btrfs root.

# Snapshots are stored within the btrfs root in folders named after
# the subvolumes, with '@' converted to '-' so nested subvolumes work
# correctly (assuming you're not using '-' in your subvolume names in
# a conflicting way). Within a subvolume's snapshot folder are the
# actual snapshots, which are named by the ISO-8601-formatted UTC time
# of script invocation, to 1-second precision, as given by the command
# 'date --utc --iso-8601=seconds'.

# On backup filesystems, snapshots are cloned with the same structure
# as the snapshots directory.

# Example: Suppose you have subvolumes @distro, @home, and @home/user
# in your main btrfs volume mounted at /root; you want to store
# snapshots under @snapshots; and you want to backup snapshots to
# /backup. Then the layout will look something like this, with more
# timestamped snapshots appearing over time:
## Original subvolume paths:
# /root/@distro
# /root/@home
# /root/@home/user
## Snapshot paths (assuming you ran this script at the respective times):
# /root/@snapshots/@distro/2016-03-31T16:43:13+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@distro/2016-04-17T23:53:47+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@distro/2016-04-18T01:24:20+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@home/2016-03-31T16:43:13+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@home/2016-04-17T23:53:47+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@home/2016-04-18T01:24:20+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@home-user/2016-03-31T16:43:13+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@home-user/2016-04-17T23:53:47+00:00
# /root/@snapshots/@home-user/2016-04-18T01:24:20+00:00
## Backup paths (assuming the backup drive wasn't available when the
## 2016-04-17 snapshots were made):
# /backup/@distro/2016-03-31T16:43:13+00:00
# /backup/@distro/2016-04-18T01:24:20+00:00
# /backup/@home/2016-03-31T16:43:13+00:00
# /backup/@home/2016-04-18T01:24:20+00:00
# /backup/@home-user/2016-03-31T16:43:13+00:00

### generic utility functions ###

# list of commands to run on exit
EXIT_TRAPS=()
## Usage: trap run-exit-traps EXIT
# Run everything in ${exit_traps[@]}.
run-exit-traps() {
    local i
    for i in "${EXIT_TRAPS[@]}"; do
        msg "Running exit trap: $i"
        eval "$i"
    done
}
trap run-exit-traps EXIT # Might only work on Linux+Bash.

## Usage: add-exit-trap "command1 [arg1 ...]" ...
# Adds given command(s) to the list of things to run on script exit.
##
# Note: Each argument must be a complete eval-able string, so commands
# with quoted arguments should be given like "command 'quoted arg'".
add-exit-trap() {
    EXIT_TRAPS+=("$@")
}

## Usage: fatal "message about fatal error"
# Formats the given error message, outputs it to stderr, and exits the
# script.
##
# VERBOSITY: any
fatal() {
    echo -e "\e[31mError:\e[0;1m $*\e[0m" >&2
    exit 1
}

## Usage: msg "text to display"
# Outputs a message with a bit of formatting. This should be used
# instead of echo almost everywhere in this script.
##
# VERBOSITY: -1
msg() {
    [ "$VERBOSITY" -lt "-1" ] || echo -e "\e[1m$*\e[0m"
}

## Usage: cmd goal command [args ...]
# Normal function: Displays goal and runs given command (with given
# args as applicable). Exits script on error.
##
# In debug mode: Displays goal and shows command that would have been
# attempted.
##
# Note: Every simple system-changing command in this script should be
# ran via cmd. Use 'cmd-eval' if you need shell features like unix
# pipes.
##
# TODO: This should be merged with cmd-eval, but that seems to require
# a sophisticated string-escaping function to convert this one's
# variadicness into an eval'able string.
##
# VERBOSITY: 0 (goals), 1 (commands), 2 (outputs)

        fi || fatal "Could not $1."
    fi
}

## Usage: cmd-eval goal "string to evaluate"
# Normal function: Displays goal and evals given string. Exits script
# on error.
##
# In debug mode: Displays goald and shows code that would have been
# eval'd.
##
# This is the less-automatic variant of 'cmd', intended for cases
# where things like unix pipes are required.
##
# NOTE: You need to manually add "sudo" to commands ran with
# this. Thus this is also good for non-root commands.
##
# VERBOSITY: 0 (goals), 1 (commands), 2 (outputs)
cmd-eval() {

## Usage: dbg messages [...]
# Outputs a message with a bit of formatting. This should be used
# instead of echo for showing internal state for debugging.
##
# VERBOSITY: 3
dbg() {
    [ "$VERBOSITY" -lt 3 ] || echo -e "\e[33m$*\e[0m"
}

## Usage: exists paths...
# Check if given paths exist, giving a message and returning 1 on
# first non-existent path. Useful for, e.g., "if exists
# /path/to/place; then do-thing; fi".
exists() {

            return 1
        fi
        shift
    done
}

## Usage: list separator last_separator thing [...]
# Lists all the things, separating them with the given separator,
# switching to last_separator for separating the last two things.
## Example:
# my_list="$(list ',' ', and' a b c)"
# echo "$my_list" # a, b, and c
list() {
    local sep="$1" last="$2" out
    shift 2

### btrfs utility functions ###

## Usage: last_backup_name="$(last-backup "$(backup-dirs[@]}")"
# Get name of last backup found in all given backup directories, or
# empty string if they have no backup in common.
##
# NOTE: This assumes that this script is the only source of items in

        last="$snap"
        break
    done

    # Show result, if any.

### btrfs actions ###

## Usage: snapshot from-root to-snapshot-dir subvol

## Usage: del-older-than location time min_keep_count subvolume
# Deletes btrfs snapshots for 'subvolume' at 'location' that are older

### high-level snapshot actions ###

## Usage: make-snaps from to subvolumes [...]
# Make a read-only btrfs snapshot at 'to' for each given subvolume in
# 'from'. This is directly useful for being able to revert file
# changes (which is _NOT_ a backup!), and the snapshots are useful for
# (incrementally) copying subvolumes to other devices for real
# backups.
make-snaps() {

## Usage: copy-latest from to subvolumes [...]

## Usage: delete-old snap_dir time subvolumes [...]

## Usage: delete-old snap_dir time min_keep_count subvolumes [...]
# Delete snapshots older than 'time' from 'snap_dir', keeping at least
# the latest 'min_keep_count' snapshots regardless of age. 'time' is a
# date/time string as used by "date --date=STRING". For example, a
# time of "3 days ago" will delete snapshots which are more than 3
# days old. This is useful when the device for 'from' doesn't have
# much space and the device for 'to' acts as an archive of the old
# states of 'from'.
delete-old-keep-n() {

### main stuff ###

## Usage: config_path="$(get-config-path)"
# Gets the path to the script's config.
get-config-path() {
    get-config backup-btrfs/control_script -path
}

# This explains how the config file works.
CONFIG_USE="List of commands to run for backup-btrfs. This is actually a mini
script used to control what backup-btrfs does. It works by calling the
'make-snaps', 'copy-latest', and 'delete-old' functions with the
desired arguments. These functions work as follows:

make-snaps from to subvolumes ...

    Snapshot each listed subvolume under 'from', saving the snapshots
    under 'to'. Note that 'from' and 'to' must be under the same btrfs
    mount point, since snapshots merely copy references to the
    underlying data.

copy-latest from to subvolumes ...

    Copy the latest snapshot of each listed subvolume from 'from' to
    'to'. Note that this is only useful if 'from' and 'to' are on
    different partitions (and usually on different physical devices,
    like for backups), since otherwise lightweight snapshots could be
    used for the same effect without doubling disk usage.

delete-old location time subvolumes ...

    Delete all snapshots older than 'time' from listed subvolumes
    under 'location'. Note that 'time' is recommended to be relative
    like 'three weeks ago' and should probably be longer than the
    frequency that backups are done to the location.

To see an example for clarity, it is recommended to choose to edit the
default config. It is a reasonable starting template for basic backup
cases."

## Usage: check-config
# Checks that the config exists, exiting the script with a fatal error
# if not.
check-config() {
